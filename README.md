# The Sky's Beyond
**Requires the Vanderlin Box2d Library to run**
The Sky’s Beyond takes place in the expansive world of outer space. Within a triangular spaceship, you explore the hues of planets, the darkness of space, and the light of stars. It utilizes miniature sized planets alongside traditional physics, which cause objects to be pulled in by the gravity of planets. However, one must be careful not to collide into objects crash and damage to the ship. You can shoot the normal weapon by pressing 'Z', or unleash a cannon by pressing 'X' to clear the path.
